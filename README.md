My assignment

Part A

c. Accessibility Steps Taken

The Haukai Restaurant website I have created has attempted to integrate key usability elements into its design.

A visual hierarchy has been established to ensure that key content desired by the business is clearly presented to the 
viewer of their website. The user is quickly able to have their attention drawn to key areas of the site which the business 
wishes to communicate (i.e. specials, location, hours etc).
