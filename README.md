Part A

c. Accessibility Steps Taken

The Haukai Restaurant website I have created has attempted to integrate key usability elements into its design.

A visual hierarchy has been established to ensure that key content desired by the business is clearly presented to the viewer of their website. The user is quickly able to have their attention drawn to key areas of the site which the business wishes to communicate (i.e. specials, location, hours etc).



The interface is simple, and the navigation is positioned in a clear way for the user to navigate around the site. There is a consistent layout throughout the site with pages being laid out in a similar manner. The colours are clear and inoffensive and allow the viewer to clearly read text and find information. Colour has been applied with the user in mind as well as to market the website and its product also. The primary colours of white, black and red are significant colours for the Maori of New Zealand. All text is highly legible. 

Information is short and concise and there is adequate empty space around text and images to avoid overloading the user. Alt text has been included where possible to provide information about inserted images and other graphics. Clear headings are provided and highlighted so that users can clearly find the information they require, and links are provided back to the main/index page along with to other pages on the site to allow ease of access to desired content. In all, it is a basic but intuitive sight which will allow the user to discover the information they wish to know quickly and easily. 

The site has also attempted to cater for mobile users and appears well on mobiles and tablets as well as on desktop personal computers. It has been tested on several key browsers and the response time for upload on all have genuinely delivered strong results. It appears to load smoothly on most of the major browsers it has been tested on. The content can be easily accessed using touchscreens or through the use of a keyboard alone. 

Efforts have been taken to provide information that the services offered by the business are credible. Clear information about the restaurantâ€™s services are provided including images and prices of many of their services. Contact information about the business is also supplied and site visitors can learn a bit about the individuals operating the business. This can greatly help to create piece of mind for shoppers. Certificates could also establish this credibility, and these are all key to putting people at ease whom may feel that the business might be a scam. 

The site through its security protocol attempts to assure their clients that all information collected about them will be kept private and confidential and will not be abused for other purposes. 

ARIA landmarks have been established for easier navigation and as landmark roles for identifying the content of each section within a page (i.e. the use of tags, nav, main, div, form etc). This helps to announce the start and end of each landmark on a web page. 

The form itself has been designed for accessibility with clearly defined labels and clearly established groupings. It is facile to navigate around and lays out clear instructions for the user to follow. Submitting the form is a clear and easily identifiable process. 

To create a site which is accessible for those with disabilities, strong colours have been used and descriptions of content have been provided where possible. The font has been set at a readable size. Images and links have been created at a larger clickable size to ensure clarity of choice and the text employed has kept simple for users with learning disabilities and for those whom do not want to be bombarded with overly wordy descriptions. Descriptions to links have also been supplied.
